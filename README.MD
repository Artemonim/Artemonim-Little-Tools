# LittleTools

A collection of command-line utilities for various file processing tasks, built as a modular, extensible ecosystem.

## About The Project

LittleTools has been refactored from a collection of individual scripts into a modern, package-based Python project. The new architecture uses a central command-line interface (CLI) tool, `lt`, which dynamically discovers and loads all installed "tool" plugins.

This design allows for better separation of concerns, easier maintenance, and the ability to install only the tools you need.

### Key Features

-   **Modular Architecture**: Each tool (`video-converter`, `whisper-transcriber`, etc.) is a separate, installable Python package.
-   **Extensible CLI**: The main `lt` command automatically finds and integrates any installed LittleTools plugin.
-   **Dependency Management**: Each tool manages its own dependencies via its `pyproject.toml` file.
-   **Simplified Setup**: A single setup script handles the creation of a virtual environment and the installation of all tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher.
-   (Windows) PowerShell for running the setup script.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/LittleTools.git
    cd LittleTools
    ```

2.  **Run the setup script:**
    This script will create a local Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and install all the LittleTools packages in editable mode.

    For Windows (in PowerShell):

    ```powershell
    .\start.ps1
    ```

    If you encounter any execution policy issues in PowerShell, you may need to run:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
    # Then run the script again
    .\start.ps1
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    After the setup script completes, you must activate the virtual environment to use the tools.

    -   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    -   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```cmd
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    -   **Linux / macOS:**
        ```sh
        source ./.venv/bin/activate
        ```

## Usage

Once the virtual environment is activated, all tools are available through the main `lt` command.

**1. List all available tool commands:**

```sh
lt --help
```

**2. Get help for a specific tool:**
Each tool is a subcommand. You can get detailed help for its specific options.

```sh
lt video-converter --help
lt whisper-transcriber --help
lt cyrillic-remover --help
```

**3. Run a tool:**
Provide the tool name as a subcommand, followed by its specific arguments.

_Example: Convert all videos in the input directory_

```sh
# Assumes videos are in 0-INPUT-0 and output goes to 0-OUTPUT-0
lt video-converter convert --quality 30 --fps 60
```

_Example: Transcribe all audio in Russian_

```sh
lt whisper-transcriber run --model large-v3 --language ru
```
