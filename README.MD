-   Audio re-encoded to high-quality AAC (48 kHz, 320 kbps).
-   Interactive-only mode for guided input.

**Dependencies:**

-   Pillow 9+ (Python dependency)
-   ffmpeg (system dependency)

**Usage:**

```bash
# This tool is launched via the interactive menu (menu.py)
# python VideoTools/Image_Audio_To_Video.py # (Not typically run directly)
```

## Text Tools

## Agent Tools

### GitHub Issue Synchronization Script for Cursor IDE

`ghsync.py` allows your Agent to interact with GitHub issues in your repository.

It enables reading all labels and issues, editing existing issues, and creating new ones. The script supports changing issue status but cannot delete issues.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2.  **GitHub CLI (gh)**: The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) must be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).

**Usage:**

Add the `.cursor` folder to your repository and read [ghsync_Readme.md](/AgentTools/GithubIssueSynchronizationScript/.cursor/Gitdata/ghsync_Readme.md).
