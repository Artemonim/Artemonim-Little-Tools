A collection of small utility tools created for [personal commercial and non-commercial needs](/LICENSE). These tools aim to solve specific problems efficiently and can be used across different environments.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

For easy environment management and automated file processing, use our setup scripts:

**Windows (Recommended):**

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

**Windows (Alternative):**

```cmd
start.bat
```

**Manual (All platforms):**

```bash
python menu.py
```

The startup scripts will:

-   ‚úÖ Check Python 3.8+ installation
-   ‚úÖ Create/verify virtual environment with pip
-   ‚úÖ Handle common environment issues automatically
-   ‚úÖ Launch the interactive menu

**Features:**

-   üìÅ Automatic file processing (`0-INPUT-0` ‚Üí `0-OUTPUT-0`)
-   üîß Single virtual environment for all tools
-   üì¶ Install only the dependencies you need
-   üöÄ Batch processing for multiple files
-   üßπ Optional source file cleanup after processing
-   üé§ Audio/Video transcription with OpenAI Whisper

See [SETUP_README.md](SETUP_README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Agent Tools

### GitHub Issue Synchronization Script for Cursor IDE

`ghsync.py` allows your Agent to interact with GitHub issues in your repository.

It enables reading all labels and issues, editing existing issues, and creating new ones. The script supports changing issue status but cannot delete issues.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2.  **GitHub CLI (gh)**: The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) must be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).

**Usage:**

Add the `.cursor` folder to your repository and read [ghsync_Readme.md](/AgentTools/GithubIssueSynchronizationScript/.cursor/Gitdata/ghsync_Readme.md).
